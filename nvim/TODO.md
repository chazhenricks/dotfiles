# Things I want to change about my nvim setup 

### Things I Like 
- telescope - finding files and text within files 
- lsp 
- most keymaps
- harpoon

### Things I want to update
- Git flow - find better solution for git integration 
- unit test execution - find way to run unit tests associated with a function 
- getting whichkey setup would be nice 
- need a good debugger solution. Currently opening up VSCode for debugging, but would like to get it all in the same place 
- tmux copy/paste - is there a better way to copy/paste text? The built in tmux way is cluncky. 


### nitpicky 
- golang indentation 
- excluding filetypes in a telescope search 
- add new file to current directoy


### Vim Things I Want To Improve
- not using NVim Tree (navigating without it) 
- creating new directories/files  (how to do without tree)
- running tests/executing commands from nvim without a tmux slpit (how to run a test without breaking out of vim) 
- more text editing/vim moves 
- touch typing
